# Example Blog Article

This is an example Markdown file to show you how to write blog posts.

## Introduction

This article demonstrates the Markdown syntax and structure you can use for your blog posts. Writing in Markdown is much easier than writing HTML directly!

## Why Markdown?

Here are some benefits:

- **Simple syntax** - No closing tags needed
- **Easy to read** - Looks like plain text
- **Fast to write** - Focus on content, not formatting
- **Convertible** - Can be converted to HTML automatically

## Code Examples

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Greet someone by name"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## Formatting Text

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code` easily.

## Lists

### Unordered List
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item
- Item 3

### Ordered List
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Links and Images

You can add [links](https://example.com) and images:

![Example image](image.jpg)

## Blockquotes

> This is a quote or important note.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Conclusion

This example shows the basic Markdown syntax. For more details, see the `BLOG_WRITING_GUIDE.md` file.
